# Carbon Emission Optimization - Shell.ai

## Problem Statement

This is a **Fleet Optimization Challenge** from Shell.ai focused on minimizing carbon emissions from a commercial vehicle fleet over 16 years (2023-2038) while meeting transportation demand.

### Objective
**Minimize total carbon emissions by 79.4%** (from 11.7M to 2.4M) while:
- Meeting all transportation demand (growing from 17M to 25M km)
- Managing fleet costs (purchase, fuel, maintenance, insurance)
- Balancing vehicle types (BEV, Diesel, LNG) and fuel choices

## Data Files

| File | Description | Key Info |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `carbon_emissions.csv` | Yearly emission targets | 79.4% reduction required |
| `demand.csv` | Transportation demand | 4 sizes × 4 distances × 16 years |
| `vehicles.csv` | Vehicle specifications | 3 types (BEV/Diesel/LNG), costs, ranges |
| `fuels.csv` | Fuel properties | Emissions, costs, trends |
| `vehicles_fuels.csv` | Fuel compatibility | Consumption rates |
| `cost_profiles.csv` | Lifecycle costs | Depreciation, insurance, maintenance |
| `sample_submission.csv` | Solution format | Buy/Use/Sell actions |

## Quick Start

### 1. Explore the Data
```bash
python data_explorer.py
```
This will:
- Load and analyze all data files
- Print key statistics and insights
- Generate visualizations (`data_overview.png`)

### 2. Read the Documentation
- **`PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`** - Detailed problem explanation, data dictionary, solution strategies
- **`data_overview.png`** - Visual summary of key trends

### 3. Key Insights from Data

**Carbon Targets:**
- 2023: 11,677,957 emissions → 2038: 2,404,387 emissions
- Average yearly reduction: 618,238

**Demand Growth:**
- 2023: 17.2M km → 2038: 25.3M km (+47.3%)
- Largest segment: S1 vehicles (41.8%), D2 distances (41.7%)

**Vehicle Economics:**
- BEV costs decrease: $187k → $130k (S1)
- Diesel/LNG costs increase (inflation)
- Electricity cost drops 45.8%

**Fuel Emissions (kg CO2/unit):**
- Electricity: 0.000
- BioLNG: 0.378
- HVO: 0.488
- LNG: 2.486
- B20: 3.049

## Solution Approach

### Decision Variables
For each year, decide:
1. **Buy**: Which vehicles to purchase
2. **Use**: Which vehicles to operate (with which fuel, on which routes)
3. **Sell**: Which vehicles to dispose of

### Constraints
- Meet all demand (size × distance combinations)
- Respect vehicle capacity limits
- Use only compatible fuels
- Maintain fleet balance

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Early years (2023-2027)**: Use diesel/LNG, introduce BEVs for short routes
2. **Transition (2028-2033)**: Increase BEV adoption, phase out high-emission vehicles
3. **Final push (2034-2038)**: Maximize BEVs, use bio-fuels for long-distance only

## How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy
```

### 2. Run the Optimizer
```bash
python optimizer.py
```
This will:
- Load all data files
- Build the optimization model using `scipy.optimize.milp`
- Solve for the optimal fleet strategy
- Generate `submission.csv` with the results

### 3. Explore Data (Optional)
```bash
python data_explorer.py
```

## Resources

- **Optimization Libraries**: `pulp`, `scipy.optimize`, `cvxpy`
- **Data Analysis**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- **Problem Type**: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
